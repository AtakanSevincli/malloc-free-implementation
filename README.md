# malloc-free-implementation
In this project, you will be implementing a memory allocator for programmers. Your functions will be similar to those provided by malloc( ) and free( ), but a little more interesting.


There are three objectives to this assignment:
1. To understand the nuances of building a memory allocator.
2. To understand the art of performance tuning for different workloads.
3. To create a shared library (which would most probably very helpful in your
whole life).
